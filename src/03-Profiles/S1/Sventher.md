# Sventher Panther 

- **Height:** 6' 2"
- **Faction:** 
  1. Kingdom
- **Decks:** 
  1. Kingdoms - Slithering Venom 
- **Description:**
Sventher is like the typical emo that is most religious to the stereotypes. Dramatic with every word that is descended from his mouth to the 
ever so listening boxes of mankind. He has his hair covering his left side of his face, and has many snake tattoos.
He is the most weirdest member, and in terms of competitiveness, he wishes his opponent to be poisoned, not clear
whether if it's metaphorical or literal.
