- **Description:**
Syco is an interesting person, sort of like a mad scientist in a small person. 
He plays the Delphic faction, Cyborgs and shows his superior intellect as he 
thinks of strategy as a simple program. He loves using opponent's resources to help
him out, and has a dark side that is felt but hard to analyze upon.
