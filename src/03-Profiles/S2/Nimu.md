- **Description:**
Nimu, is a member of the Corruquatro team, and is a former champion as well. His skill is seen as 
he loves to bury his opponent's summons, and use them with his mummy army. He is seen to be quiet 
and very serious, and someone you wouldn't typically want to be stuck in a conversation with. He's 
not much of a team player, and chooses to finish a match as soon as possible so he doesn't need
to interact with the opponent for long.
