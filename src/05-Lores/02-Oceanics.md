# Oceanics

The waters carry not only it’s tides and waves, but also multiple strong Summons who have come to be known as the Faction, Oceanics. Many years ago the seas were drowned in battles to see which underwater nation shall rule the dark deep amongst them all, the land Summons hadn't mind it much as this battle rarely impacted them and as such ignored it. 

After a year of these ongoing wars, two of the strongest groups had grew bored of it, and wanted to find a remedy to their situation. Unfortunately neither of the groups would accept peace unless they ruled supreme and as such they held countless meetings usually ending in some sort of violent outcome.  

Unknown to them during these meetings the sons (or daughters) of the two groups became friends, and were becoming closer to each other during every following meeting, although they cared not for their parents battle. One meeting the children were playing together outside of the palace, when they saw a very shiny metal piece attached to a thin string elegantly floating through the ocean.  

_`"The curisoity of the dangers or perspect of the above had peeked their interest"`_

The two kids approached the metal piece, realizing it was hook shaped _(this was a fishing line of one of the legendary fishermen who became part of Whirlemo’s crew)_ and one of them decided to touch it. Blood had started to gush out and spreading through the water as a flesh wound from one of the child's arms was created by the quickly receding hook, the unharmed child went to get their parents quickly, but when both the groups' leaders got there, they were quick to blame each other as to what happened. 

They swore to destroy each other, the children seemingly would never meet again. Over the following years they grew up excelling in their battle abilities more than any of their peers while their parents grew old, all this time the kids had only wished to play with each other again and knew the only way to do that was to stop the war.  

After they grew of age and proved their worth in battle, they became the leaders of their respective groups and as such they joined together as allies against their parents wishes and they immediately began writing up the constitution of their new collective faction that would rule the sea.  

One of the old group leaders accepted this change, as to support their child but the other still wanted revenge on the new leader of their opposing outdated view because he still believed that it was them that hurt his child all that long ago.  

The old angry leader decided to invite the new opposing leader to a small meeting, and poisoned the new leader, in the new leader’s dying moments he killed the old leader only to find his fellow leader, the child they met so long ago looking in shock as the two closest people to them dying in front of them without any explanation.  

The faction had still been created but the leader kept himself away from everyone and left the remaining old leader to control the faction, newly deemed as the Oceanic. They deemed everything in the seas as theirs, even though there were some who didn’t care or deem themselves a part of this new faction _(The great Whirlemo)_.
