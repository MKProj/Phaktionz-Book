# Whirlemo and The Fisherman

A dragon is born as the first creation of a creature whose origin could start with nature itself, born without access to his true potential he was abandoned to the cold ocean waves. Not knowing his true home, he made do amongst the waves.  

The only thing he was left with was a name “Whirl” and from such he evolved for a millennia, adapting to the cold waves and becoming a myth amongst the land creatures as he feeds amongst anything that enters too far into the sea. In the modern day a group of legendary fishermen set out to catch this dragon, instead they found a much less threatening Summon.  

They decided to catch it and as they approached it, it had seemed they got caught in what seems to be an instantaneously created maelstrom and were dragged under the waves into the deepest trenches of the ocean. The fishermen had quickly accepted their fate, all but one, a child amongst them who was a prodigy in his field, was desperate in trying to find a way to survive.  

A large dragon seething with anger approached the child, he asked the child,  

 _`"Is survival worth it, if possible with a cost that can't be paid in your lifetime?"`_  

The desperate child not caring for the consequences accepted without hesitation and thus became part of a crew, able to thrive underwater but lost to the surface world and now led by a Dragon looking for that who abandoned him on land with fury to any surface.  

The crew taught the dragon how to fish, and though originally the dragon deemed this skill useless they later tweaked their abilities to be able to snatch people near the shore with harpoons and strong rope and drag them into the depths. On a side note the fishermen considered their leader `Emo` as he was always angry at his parents and rebellious, dubbing the name `Whirlemo`.
