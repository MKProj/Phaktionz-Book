# Promote
Promote brings forth two new Tiers, 0 and 4. A Tier 0/4 Summon has **limit of 1**.

## Tier 0
Tier 0’s are Summons that are placed and have a realm invocation ability, as well as having these attributes:
- Tier: 0
- DMG: 0
- Type: T/S
- Promote: Yes
- All Tier 0’s may not be battled, and treated as a Realm Invocation

**Promote**:  To Promote a Tier 0, is to flip it to it’s other side where it resides
as Tier 4, and is placed at the Tier 3 location. To Promote, the player must satisfy a Promote condition that is described on the Card. 
If you control Summons on the Battlefield and choose to Promote, the Summons will be demoted.

## Tier 4 
Tier 4’s are usually a win condition card and are built to not stay on the field for long. While you control a Tier 4 you cannot have any other Summons
on the Battlefield. As well as that, they have the following attributes:

- Tier: 4
- DMG: 7/8
- Type: T/S
- All Tier 4’s cannot be demoted in Battle nor be demoted by any abilities
- At the end of each End Phase the player takes Damage equal to it’s DMG
    - Refusal to pay will result in it being exiled
