# Game-Mechanics

- When a Summon battles it becomes disabled (turned sideways)  

- To place a Tier 2 or higher summon, you must demote Tiers total to the Summon’s Tier. 
    - For example, a Tier 2 may be placed by demoting a Tier 2 or 2 Tier 1s.  

- At the start of the game, after the turn order is chosen, both players may mulligan any cards in their hand once.  

- If a card’s ability were to break one of these rules, the card’s ability takes precedence.  

- When battling, a Player takes DMG equal to the difference between the Summons.  

- If a Summon that battles has less DMG than the opposing, no DMG is dealt.  

- If a Summon that battles has more DMG than the opposing, the Opponent takes the difference, and the Summon is demoted (except if it’s Tier 3+).
