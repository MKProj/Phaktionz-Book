# Phaktionz-CLI

Currently Phaktionz-CLI is only available for Debian Linux systems, and is 
being worked on to apply to other systems. However for this current prospect,
this section will assume you will have a Debian Linux operating system. 

## Download 
As mentioned in the beginning, to get Phaktionz-CLI you do the following commands:  

```bash
# Make sure rust is installed
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
 # Install git 
$ sudo apt install git-all # Debian Linux Example
$ git --version # MacOS example
# Install MDBook
$ cargo install mdbook
# Install Phaktionz
$ cargo install phaktionz
```

Now to use Phaktionz, its quite easy as using the phaktionz command: 
```bash
# For the current Version 0.3.3
$ phaktionz
# output
Phaktionz CLI Wiki 0.3.3

USAGE:
    phaktionz <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    info       Gives info about Factions or it's Category
    profile    Displays the profile of specified Character
    rules      Displays the various rules in Phaktionz
    story      Read the Story Concepts of Phaktionz
```
Many of the commands are straightforward, and if you need information on it, use list as the option.  
```bash
$ phaktionz rules list
# output
Available Options for Rules: 
        types: Lists out all Summon/Invocation Types
        game-mech: Lists out all the Game Mechanics
        terms: Lists out all the key terms
        c-pile: Describes what Creation Pile is
        promote: Describes what Promote is
        all: Does all commands above
```

However the only exception to this is the **story** command, where it wasn't possible 
to just put list in it, instead you do the following: 

```bash
# You want to do phaktionz story <season> 0 <pdf-application>
# To get a list of Season 1 episodes, do the following:
$ phaktionz story 1 0 okular # can be any pdf app, I personally love okular
```
