# Phaktionz-CLI

Currently Phaktionz-CLI is only available for Debian Linux systems, and is 
being worked on to apply to other systems. However for this current prospect,
this section will assume you will have a Debian Linux operating system. 

## Download 
As mentioned in the beginning, to get Phaktionz-CLI you do the following commands:  
```bash
#First add the repository 
$ echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://mkproj.github.io/Packages/ ./" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
# Next update your packages 
$ sudo apt update
#Now you can install Phaktionz-CLI
$ sudo apt install phaktionz
```

Now to use Phaktionz, its quite easy as using the phaktionz command: 
```bash
# For the current Version 0.3.3
$ phaktionz
Phaktionz CLI Wiki 0.3.3

    phaktionz <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

    rules      Displays the various rules in Phaktionz

Many of the commands are straightforward, and if you need information on it, use list as the option.  
```bash
$ phaktionz rules list
Available Options for Rules: 
        types: Lists out all Summon/Invocation Types
        game-mech: Lists out all the Game Mechanics

        c-pile: Describes what Creation Pile is
        promote: Describes what Promote is
        all: Does all commands above
```

However the only exception to this is the **story** command, where it wasn't possible 
to just put list in it, instead you do the following: 

```bash
# You want to do story <season> 0 <pdf-application>
# To get a list of Season 1 episodes, do the following:
$ phaktionz 1 0 okular # can be any pdf app, I personally love okular
```
