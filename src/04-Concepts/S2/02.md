# Episode 2 Advance Classes

- Zane and Lulo both prepare for classes at Corruquatro Univesity, considered to be the best 
Phaktionz University, and since they won Cities, are eligible for Advance classes. 

- When they go there, they meet a few other classmates, and Zane meets a fellow named Zepellin, and 
when they meet, they both get a sudden headache. Nothing much to think of that, they exchange information 
on who they are and their position in Phaktionz. 

- As they meet Zepellin's 'gang', _(Lyla, Nimu, Syco, and Hayes)_, Zane notices an awkward silence between Lulo
and Lyla when they introduce each other, as if they had already met. 

- Zane asks a weird question, and creates quite an awkward moment, when his curiosity seems to be really wondering.
> "I wonder, when you look more into Phaktionz, you could really think that it's an actual realm itself in the distant universe."

- They then proceed to classes.
- We return back to the store where Khloe is helping out, and the episode ends off when we see Lyla come into the store.
