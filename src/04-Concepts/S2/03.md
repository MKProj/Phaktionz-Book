# Episode 3 Mystery Girl

-  Starts off with Lyla appearing at the shop, and when she comes in, we also see Finn come in to consult the team.
-  We see Lyla look at Finn passing her, surprised, but still not clear to the viewer why, 
but then she goes to Lulo, and everyone just stares at him. 

- She gives him one of the books he forgot back at class, then they stare into each other's eyes, (awkwardly as the others look back and forth of them), 
and then Finn breaks the ice when he asks the team for his attention. 

- Finn asks who this girl is, and she responds disgruntled "Just a friend of Lulo's...", then Finn talks to the team about the upcoming Regionals, and that 
he feels like he can lead the team again, still not telling why he was incognito for a while.

- Finn then tells the team they will have a new member in the team, the former member in Team Alpha, Tesa Heinds. She shows off her new Mad Experiments Probers 
deck, but as Finn announces his new member, Lulo also has news for the team, he had actually joined a different team. 

- Everyone confused, he tells he wants a new experience, and that he wants to spread his wings as a Phaktionz player.
- Lulo leaves the store with Lyla, and they all suspect she's the reason, which gives the group an idea to spy on her and find out the truth about her.
