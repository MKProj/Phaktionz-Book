# Episode 13  The Prodigy

Finn sets off the team to explore other shops and see the competition. They visit a shop called Alpha Legends, where they are known to have a strong team. 

When they arrive at the shop, they see someone leave not knowing who it is, and don’t question it. (Later realizing it’s Al Kover, the missing member). 

There they see a match between Brale and Tesa, Brale playing his Oceanics and Tesa his mysterious Probers. They see the end game in which Tesa wins. 

It is announced Tesa, the Phaktionz Progidy won, Zane asks around why he’s called that and meets Tesa. Tesa shows them his Probers Deck, a faction that never recalled in Phaktionz history. The gang gets to meet the team, but they are sadly not participating. 

They tell them that their other member left (They recall that person leaving), and that it’s too late for a new member to qualify for the tourney. Tesa then asks Zane for a battle, just to see how strong he is.
