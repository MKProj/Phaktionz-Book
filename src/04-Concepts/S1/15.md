# Episode 15 The Weird Dream

Zane asleep has another vision looking into the Phaktionz Realm past, he sees a Council room, in which the three origins, and their banners are seated in a round table. The table is a circle, with each origin in the corner, with their letters where they are seated and a Z in the center. During the meeting, King (w. Kleo) and Helios (w. Hulio) are asking of Prestige’s presence, and then are told that he will not be attending. 


They talk about the apparent worm holes, or breaks in the realm that is causing chaos. In which Helios proposes borders that should be set up to deal with the situation temporarily. However each party disagree of the placement of the borders feeling that some of their realm shouldn’t be taken. This causes a huge argument to spur up, which causes problem with how Helios calls King a copycat to his creations and King accuses to the same. 

It ends with, if there’s no borders, war and chaos will break out. 
> King looks and says, “Then war it shall be!”.
They both disappear from the council room.  (At moments during the discussion, King does seem to have sudden headaches and/or rough coughs in which Kleo asks if she is okay.)  
We then return to Zane waking up sweating and confused
