# Episode 16 The Ultimate Dragon Warrior

Continues off of Episode 15 ending, and starts off with Zane completely shaken from his dream. He realizes at this point it must be something more of a dream, but he really doesn’t know what to do. 

He goes to the shop as the team has only a few days left to prepare. They are all fixing up their deck, and Zane is recommended to play a Tier 3 in his deck. Finn gives him different Warrior Tier 3’s to try out. 

Zane checks them out while he runs to get a few stuff for the gang, he runs into an old man and the cards fall to the ground. The old man with black glasses, a hat, cane and seemingly frail appearance notices he plays Phaktionz. 

> He looks at him, says “You play Phaktionz, I can see you as a pure hearted boy, sorry for this, please accept this gift.”  

He gives him cards, _“Fulthrottle the Ultimate Dragon Warrior”_, and says “you look like the right person for this.” Zane picks up the rest of the cards, and stands up to thank him, he notices the man is gone. He sees the card with him, and goes back to the shop. Lulo asks him as he notices Zane fixing his deck,  

> Zane ends off saying, “Prepared for any battle that arises me”.
