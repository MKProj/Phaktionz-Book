<p>Phaktionz is a trading card game (TCG) being made and developed by Casual Card Cafe, 
and it's content being driven focussed as a community involved card game. The whole 
objective of the game is to make your opponent deck out or in other words have no cards 
left in their deck, and this can be done in various ways. </p>
<h2 id="phaktionz-cli"><a class="header" href="#phaktionz-cli">Phaktionz-CLI</a></h2>
<p>Before continuing onto the various aspects of Phaktionz, if you would like to learn Phaktionz 
from directly on a Command Line, (currently only for Debian Linux Systems), then you may install doing the 
following commands: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#First add the repository 
$ echo &quot;deb [trusted=yes] https://mkproj.github.io/Packages/ ./&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list &gt; /dev/null
# Next update your packages 
$ sudo apt update
#Now you can install Phaktionz-CLI
$ sudo apt install phaktionz
</code></pre>
<h1 id="factions"><a class="header" href="#factions">Factions</a></h1>
<p>In Phaktionz, your deck is built upon a specific faction that consists on it's own 
unique Summons, and with it, it's own story. The factions that live within the Phaktionz 
realm is categorized by their historic timeline, and goes as the following: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="01-Phaktionz/./ch1-01-factions.html#origins">Origins</a></li>
<li><a href="01-Phaktionz/./ch1-01-factions.html#delphic">Delphics</a></li>
<li><a href="01-Phaktionz/ch1-01-factions.html#modernas">Modernas</a></li>
</ol>
<div name="origins"><h2 id="origins"><a class="header" href="#origins">Origins</a></h2></div>
Origins are the factions that were first made by the founding fathers of the Phaktionz Realm, this being Prestige and his Sorcerers;
Helios and his Mythicals; King and her animal kingdom. These Origin factions still exist in the Phaktionz present day, but not as glorious as 
it once was.
<p>Origin Factions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Sorcerers </li>
<li>Mythicals</li>
<li>Kingdoms</li>
</ul>
<div name="delphic"><h2 id="delphic"><a class="header" href="#delphic">Delphic</a></h2></div>
In the Mythical History, there was a unique Summon named Lyzor, he had been an experiment between the three Origins, and being a failed product, 
was casted off his mortal self to be a lesser entity, a shadow. He had hatred towards the Origins, and use his lesser self to possess and corrupt 
Factions, and made the Forbidden Plague pandemic, and due to it, the Factions had eventually erased themselves from history, and became the Delphic factions. 
<p>Delphic Factions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Frosters</li>
<li>Cryptics</li>
<li>Cyborgs</li>
<li>Probers</li>
<li>The Unknowns </li>
</ul>
<div name="modernas"><h2 id="modernas"><a class="header" href="#modernas">Modernas</a></h2></div>
Modernas are what you guess they are, these factions are the ones who exist in the present day. These factions are what you can consider the evolved 
Origin factions, and has the most amount of factions. As well as unlike Origin factions who believe in the Delphics as myth, the Modernas have no 
knowledge of their existence whatsoever. 
<p>Modernas Factions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oceanics </li>
<li>Alchemists </li>
<li>Descendants</li>
<li>Warriors </li>
<li>Dragons </li>
<li>Phasmas </li>
<li>Titans</li>

<p>In Phaktionz, there are two cards with their own types with them. One being <em>Summons</em> (the units), and 
<em>Invocations</em>(the sorcery/weapons/etc.). These two cards have their own types that are discussed below: </p>
<h2 id="summons"><a class="header" href="#summons">Summons</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Striker: A striker summon can battle any opponent's summon, but not the opponent directly. </li>
<li>Tech: A tech summon can only battle in it's column, and to the opponent directly. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="invocations"><a class="header" href="#invocations">Invocations</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Regular: This type of invocation can only be casted on your turn</li>
<li>Counter: This type of invocation can be casted on any turn. </li>
<li>Weapon: This type of invocations is attached (put under) a summmon on the Battlefield. </li>
<li>Realm: This type of invocation remains on the battlefield providing conditional/continuous abilities. </li>
</ol>
<h1 id="terms"><a class="header" href="#terms">Terms</a></h1>
<p>Keywords:</p>
<p><code>Summons: Units that battle in the battlefield</code></p>
<p><code>Invocations: Sorcery that may be cast to gain benefit</code></p>
<p><code>Abled: The position in which a unit may battle</code></p>
<p><code>Disabled: The position in which a unit is unable to battle (this is done with your Summon being sideways)</code></p>
<p><code>Demote: To have a summon leave the battlefield</code></p>
<p><code>Exile: To remove from play a summon</code></p>
<p><code>Tiers: Represents the rank of a summon, Tier 1 being the lowest and 4 the highest</code></p>
<p><code>DMG: The amount of cards a summon can deal an opponent to lose</code></p>
<p><code>Fizzle: To stop an opponent's play</code></p>
<p>Conditions:</p>
<p><code>L/x: Limit x per turn</code><br />
<code>Lx: Limit x per match</code></p>
<h1 id="game-mechanics"><a class="header" href="#game-mechanics">Game-Mechanics</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a Summon battles it becomes disabled (turned sideways)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To place a Tier 2 or higher summon, you must demote Tiers total to the Summon’s Tier. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a Tier 2 may be placed by demoting a Tier 2 or 2 Tier 1s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of the game, after the turn order is chosen, both players may mulligan any cards in their hand once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a card’s ability were to break one of these rules, the card’s ability takes precedence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When battling, a Player takes DMG equal to the difference between the Summons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a Summon that battles has less DMG than the opposing, no DMG is dealt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a Summon that battles has more DMG than the opposing, the Opponent takes the difference, and the Summon is demoted (except if it’s Tier 3+).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="creation-pile"><a class="header" href="#creation-pile">Creation-Pile</a></h1>
<p>Creation Pile is a pile located in the middle between your Deck and Deck
Out Pile. It’s basic function is that cards in it may be added to your hand
if they satisfy the Card’s Create condition.</p>

<p>The team has a sleepover at Finn’s, as fun as it may sound, Finn planned many twists in this sleepover. 
In the sleepover, Finn has put random challenges everywhere, and we learn a little about Finn. While exploring, Zane finds a picture of Finn and two girls.
He looks into it, and Finn finds him looking, and says that those were the two loves of his life. 
He explains wife and daughter died from an unknown random sickness. His daughter went missing and was pronounced dead after three months. </p>
<p>Finn asks Zane about his father and what happened and why Zane should redeem him. The team huddled up to hear his story. </p>
<h1 id="episode-13--the-prodigy"><a class="header" href="#episode-13--the-prodigy">Episode 13  The Prodigy</a></h1>
<p>Finn sets off the team to explore other shops and see the competition. They visit a shop called Alpha Legends, where they are known to have a strong team. </p>
<p>When they arrive at the shop, they see someone leave not knowing who it is, and don’t question it. (Later realizing it’s Al Kover, the missing member). </p>
<p>There they see a match between Brale and Tesa, Brale playing his Oceanics and Tesa his mysterious Probers. They see the end game in which Tesa wins. </p>
<p>It is announced Tesa, the Phaktionz Progidy won, Zane asks around why he’s called that and meets Tesa. Tesa shows them his Probers Deck, a faction that never recalled in Phaktionz history. The gang gets to meet the team, but they are sadly not participating. </p>
<p>They tell them that their other member left (They recall that person leaving), and that it’s too late for a new member to qualify for the tourney. Tesa then asks Zane for a battle, just to see how strong he is. </p>
<h1 id="episode-14-pro-procastinating"><a class="header" href="#episode-14-pro-procastinating">Episode 14 Pro Procastinating</a></h1>
<p>While being busy practicing for the Cities tournament, the gang also is stressed out by the winter final exams. Zane being most stressed out from the ultimatum given to him by his Mom, if he doesn’t do well, he won’t be able to play Phaktionz. </p>
<p>He asks his smartest friends, Khloe and Tesa, not asking Percy (offended) and Lulo not leaving his room, being busy studying. Khloe, and Tesa set out to help him by mixing problems and Phaktionz together. </p>
<p>Zane ends up doing really well, but to their surprise he followed Percy’s last minute pro procrastinating advice. </p>
<h1 id="episode-15-the-weird-dream"><a class="header" href="#episode-15-the-weird-dream">Episode 15 The Weird Dream</a></h1>
<p>Zane asleep has another vision looking into the Phaktionz Realm past, he sees a Council room, in which the three origins, and their banners are seated in a round table. The table is a circle, with each origin in the corner, with their letters where they are seated and a Z in the center. During the meeting, King (w. Kleo) and Helios (w. Hulio) are asking of Prestige’s presence, and then are told that he will not be attending. </p>
<p>They talk about the apparent worm holes, or breaks in the realm that is causing chaos. In which Helios proposes borders that should be set up to deal with the situation temporarily. However each party disagree of the placement of the borders feeling that some of their realm shouldn’t be taken. This causes a huge argument to spur up, which causes problem with how Helios calls King a copycat to his creations and King accuses to the same. </p>
<p>It ends with, if there’s no borders, war and chaos will break out. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>King looks and says, “Then war it shall be!”.
They both disappear from the council room.  (At moments during the discussion, King does seem to have sudden headaches and/or rough coughs in which Kleo asks if she is okay.)<br />
We then return to Zane waking up sweating and confused</p>

<p>Continues off of Episode 15 ending, and starts off with Zane completely shaken from his dream. He realizes at this point it must be something more of a dream, but he really doesn’t know what to do. </p>
<p>He goes to the shop as the team has only a few days left to prepare. They are all fixing up their deck, and Zane is recommended to play a Tier 3 in his deck. Finn gives him different Warrior Tier 3’s to try out. </p>
<p>Zane checks them out while he runs to get a few stuff for the gang, he runs into an old man and the cards fall to the ground. The old man with black glasses, a hat, cane and seemingly frail appearance notices he plays Phaktionz. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>He looks at him, says “You play Phaktionz, I can see you as a pure hearted boy, sorry for this, please accept this gift.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gives him cards, <em>“Fulthrottle the Ultimate Dragon Warrior”</em>, and says “you look like the right person for this.” Zane picks up the rest of the cards, and stands up to thank him, he notices the man is gone. He sees the card with him, and goes back to the shop. Lulo asks him as he notices Zane fixing his deck,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zane ends off saying, “Prepared for any battle that arises me”. </p>

<h1 id="phaktionz-cli-1"><a class="header" href="#phaktionz-cli-1">Phaktionz-CLI</a></h1>
<p>Currently Phaktionz-CLI is only available for Debian Linux systems, and is 
being worked on to apply to other systems. However for this current prospect,
this section will assume you will have a Debian Linux operating system. </p>
<h2 id="download"><a class="header" href="#download">Download</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the beginning, to get Phaktionz-CLI you do the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#First add the repository 
$ echo &quot;deb [trusted=yes] https://mkproj.github.io/Packages/ ./&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list &gt; /dev/null
# Next update your packages 
$ sudo apt update
#Now you can install Phaktionz-CLI
$ sudo apt install phaktionz
</code></pre>
<p>Now to use Phaktionz, its quite easy as using the phaktionz command: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># For the current Version 0.3.3
$ phaktionz
# output
Phaktionz CLI Wiki 0.3.3

USAGE:
    phaktionz &lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    info       Gives info about Factions or it's Category
    profile    Displays the profile of specified Character
    rules      Displays the various rules in Phaktionz
    story      Read the Story Concepts of Phaktionz
</code></pre>
<p>Many of the commands are straightforward, and if you need information on it, use list as the option.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ phaktionz rules list
# output
Available Options for Rules: 
        types: Lists out all Summon/Invocation Types
        game-mech: Lists out all the Game Mechanics

        promote: Describes what Promote is
        all: Does all commands above
</code></pre>
<p>However the only exception to this is the <strong>story</strong> command, where it wasn't possible 
to just put list in it, instead you do the following: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># You want to do phaktionz story &lt;season&gt; 0 &lt;pdf-application&gt;
# To get a list of Season 1 episodes, do the following:
$ phaktionz story 1 0 okular # can be any pdf app, I personally love okular
</code></pre>
